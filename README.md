# 2000_lines_of_code
Has to comprise logic, and not boilerplate code (class definitions are largely just data type and attribute declarations and nothing else as a consequence.)

Goal: to get cracked at algorithms (supposed to hit me at around 1500-1600 lines of code and then I'm enlightened, supposedly.)
current count: around 230

Current TODOs:

implement inventory and entity-entity interaction

maybe add Reinforcement Learning (Q Learning) twist on this? Project is still super early stage
