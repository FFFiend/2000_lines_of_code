So I wanna write a web server in C and iterate on that as I go.


As it stands, I dont even know what the MVP constitutes of, and I can't sit here and
wish that it would suddenly dawn upon me, when I have internet access. 

So i'm going to go look up what a web server is. 

# store process and deliver web pages to users using HTTP

# need an HTTP server. 

# use HTTP (whatever that looks like in actual functioning code) to receive and
# process requests. Can I make request with a server? No. I am not a client, that
# doesn't make any sense.

# some way of storing the kinds of things that the user requests 

# error display functionality if resource is not present (request cant be met.)


# so you also need a secure socket shell? reverse proxy? secure socket layer? 
# what are these things?

# regarding SSL's, my server should have the ability to have users establish hashed
# cryptographic keys with it to secure data that's sent through HTTP.
